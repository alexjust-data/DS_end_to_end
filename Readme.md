This repository contains the main components of the **Tsis.ai** system, a scientific trading assistant that uses real-time screen capture, image recognition, and probabilistic analysis to detect known trading patterns on the ATAS Platform.

The detailed explanations for each module and functionality have been moved to the `docs/` directory to keep this README clean and focused.
